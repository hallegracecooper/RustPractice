# Overview

This project is a **Task Manager CLI** written in **Rust**, designed to help users efficiently manage their tasks using a command-line interface. The software allows users to create, view, update, complete, and delete tasks, demonstrating key Rust concepts such as **structs, ownership, error handling, and modularization**.

The purpose of writing this software is to **gain hands-on experience with Rust** and deepen my understanding of **memory management, vector handling, and command-line input processing**. By building this project, I have strengthened my ability to write clean, modular, and efficient Rust programs.

# Future Work

There are several improvements and features that can be added in the future:

- **Persistent Storage**: Store tasks in a file so they remain available after closing the program.
- **Task Filtering & Sorting**: Implement search, sorting by due date, or categorization.
- **Error Handling Enhancements**: Improve user input validation and error handling.
- **Concurrency**: Implement multi-threading for handling large numbers of tasks.
- **User Interface**: Build a GUI version using Rust frameworks like Tauri or Druid.
